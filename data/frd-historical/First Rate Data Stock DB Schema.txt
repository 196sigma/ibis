Here's a potential database schema for stock prices at various bars and adjustment types:
Tables:
1. Securities:
   * id (INT PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier for the security
   * ticker (VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE): Stock ticker symbol
   * name (VARCHAR(255)): Name of the company
   * exchange (VARCHAR(50)): Stock exchange the security is traded on
   * currency (VARCHAR(10)): Currency the prices are denominated in
2. PriceBars:
   * id (INT PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier for the price bar
   * security_id (INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Securities(id)): Foreign key to the security
   * bar_size (INT): Size of the bar in minutes (e.g., 1, 5, 15, 60)
   * start_time (DATETIME): Start time of the bar
   * open (DECIMAL(10,2)): Opening price
   * high (DECIMAL(10,2)): Highest price within the bar
   * low (DECIMAL(10,2)): Lowest price within the bar
   * close (DECIMAL(10,2)): Closing price
   * volume (BIGINT): Trading volume within the bar
3. Adjustments:
   * id (INT PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier for the adjustment
   * security_id (INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Securities(id)): Foreign key to the security
   * adjustment_date (DATE): Date the adjustment took place
   * type (VARCHAR(50)): Type of adjustment (e.g., split, dividend)
   * factor (DECIMAL(10,4)): Adjustment factor (e.g., 2:1 split would have a factor of 0.5)
4. AdjustedPrices:
   * id (INT PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier for the adjusted price
   * price_bar_id (INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES PriceBars(id)): Foreign key to the price bar
   * adjustment_id (INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Adjustments(id)): Foreign key to the adjustment
   * open (DECIMAL(10,2)): Adjusted opening price
   * high (DECIMAL(10,2)): Adjusted highest price
   * low (DECIMAL(10,2)): Adjusted lowest price
   * close (DECIMAL(10,2)): Adjusted closing price
   * volume (BIGINT): Adjusted trading volume
Relationships:
* One security can have many price bars at different granularities.
* A price bar can have many adjustments applied to it.
* An adjustment applies to multiple price bars across different granularities.
* One adjusted price is calculated by applying an adjustment to a specific price bar.
Points to consider:
* You might want to add additional columns to the Securities table depending on your needs (e.g., sector, industry).
* You can store price data with higher precision if needed (e.g., for tick-by-tick data).
* You can add indexes to optimize queries based on your expected usage patterns.
* This schema assumes bar data is stored separately from adjustments. It's possible to combine them depending on your specific needs and storage limitations.
This is a basic schema that can be adapted to your specific requirements. Be sure to consider your storage needs, query patterns, and future scalability when designing your final schema.
