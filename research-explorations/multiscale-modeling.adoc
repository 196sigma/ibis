= Multiscale Modeling

*Question:* How to integrate forecasts across different temporal resolutions? We want to do this to take advantage of potential patterns across different scales (e.g. daily vs monthly.)
We update the fine level data using Jeffrey's rule, which involves adjusting the daily values based on the coarse level information.

* Train models at each resolution -- 1min, 5min, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, annually. Then ... ?
    * use the predictions from a coarser resolution as features in the finer resolution models (how?)
* Is this just STL decomposition? Will simple smoothing work?
* How does predictability vary across resolutions?
