## About
Ibis is a suite of tools and models for forecasting and sequential decision-making.

## TODO
### First Rate Data
* Figure out a way to append new First Rate Data to existing archive
* address bars with zero volume that are thus missing
* compare bars across roll-up periods (e.g. roll up 1min bars to 5min and compare to 5min bars)

## Data Sources
See data-sources spreadsheet for more information.
* All point-in-time[The unrevised data series as would have been available at the time of release.] data series from FRED (link)
